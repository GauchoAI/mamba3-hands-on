# Mamba-3 Hands-On — Findings Log

A running lab notebook as we explore the Mamba-3 paper (Lahoti et al., ICLR 2026)
by implementing a minimal version from scratch and running experiments on Apple
Silicon MPS. Each entry corresponds to a commit.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.15569
Official repo: https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba (CUDA-only)

## Entry 1 — Setup and minimal SISO block

**Commit:** `init` — the foundation.

**What we built**
- A ~200-line pure-PyTorch Mamba-3 block (`mamba3_minimal.py`) with no custom
  kernels. Runs on MPS / CPU / CUDA. Sequential scan (slow but correct).
- A matched Mamba-2-style baseline in the same file (same block structure,
  missing only the two innovations we care about).
- A parity task (`parity_experiment.py`) — the exact benchmark where the paper
  reports Mamba-2 at ~0.9% and Mamba-3 at 100%.

**The three innovations in minimal form**
1. **Trapezoidal gate** → a single learnable sigmoid `trap` per head, blending
   current and previous `(B · x)` outer products before the state update.
2. **Complex dynamics via data-dependent RoPE** → a slice of `in_proj` produces
   per-step `angles`; cumulative phase is `cumsum(angles * DT_mean)`; we rotate
   B and C (not the state) via pairwise RoPE. Real-only ops, complex behaviour.
3. **MIMO** → not implemented in this entry (SISO only, rank=1).

**Sanity**
- Forward + backward pass OK on MPS. 7.8k params for `d_model=32, d_state=16`.

## Entry 2 — The operator-precedence bug, and parity solved

**Commit:** `fix: A sign / train parity`

**The bug**
```python
A = -F.softplus(dd_A).clamp(max=-A_floor)
```
This parses as `-(softplus(dd_A).clamp(max=-A_floor))`. Since softplus is
positive, the clamp forces it to `-A_floor`, and negation flips it to `+A_floor`.
Result: A was positive, so `decay = exp(A·DT) > 1` — the state **grew**
slightly at every step instead of decaying. Both models were broken identically,
which is why both sat at ~50% on parity initially. Classic.

**The fix**
```python
A = (-F.softplus(dd_A)).clamp(max=-A_floor)
```

**Parity results (L=16, 400 steps, AdamW lr=3e-3)**

| Model | Params | Final loss | Acc (all pos) | Acc (last pos) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mamba-2-like | 7,690 | 0.590 | 56.4% | 51.0% |
| **Mamba-3** | 8,074 | **0.013** | **99.9%** | **99.7%** |
| Random | — | — | 50.0% | 50.0% |

Position-wise, Mamba-3 holds 100% across the whole sequence; Mamba-2-like
starts at 100% on the trivial positions 0–1 and degrades to random by t=6.
**Paper's central claim reproduced on a laptop.**

## Entry 3 — Mechanistic interpretability: the model found –π

**Commit:** `probe: learned phase per bit`

I asked: *what rotation did the model actually learn?* I fed the trained
Mamba-3 a sequence of all-0s, then all-1s, and inspected the per-step phase
increment `angles * DT_mean` across the 8 phase components.

The difference `phase(bit=1) – phase(bit=0)` at one component:
```
angle[0]: -3.140 rad  (-179.9°,  -0.999 * π)
```

**The model discovered, through pure gradient descent on 25k parity labels,
that it needs to rotate a phase component by exactly –π when the bit is 1.**
That is *literally* the textbook "XOR as rotation" construction. The other
7 components learned assorted non-useful rotations (64°, 20°, -113°, …) —
unused capacity, correctly ignored by the readout.

This is the kind of "theory predicts → training finds → weights confirm" loop
that makes mechanistic interpretability satisfying.

---

## Entry 4 — Harder moduli: where the minimal model runs out

**Commit:** `exp: modular counting mod 3 and mod 5`

**Task** Same as parity but inputs and target in `{0, ..., M-1}`, target is
`cumsum(x) mod M`. Ideal per-step rotation is `2π/M` (or an integer multiple).

**Results (L=16, 800 steps)**

| M | Random | Mamba-2-like (acc_all) | Mamba-3 (acc_all) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 50.0% | 62.6% | **99.9%** |
| 3 | 33.3% | 44.8% | 46.1% |
| 5 | 20.0% | 31.2% | 32.3% |

Parity works; mod 3 and mod 5 don't. Both models stay near random at higher
moduli.

**What this means.** Parity is uniquely easy in the rotation framing: you only
need *one* phase component tuned to π, and the readout is a 2-way classifier.
Mod 3 and mod 5 demand:
- A precisely-tuned angle (`2π/3 ≈ 120°`, `2π/5 = 72°`) — small errors compound
  over the sequence so readout degrades fast.
- A readout that discriminates 3 or 5 states from a rotating 2D point, which
  needs more state capacity than our `d_state=16, headdim=16` minimal config.

**Not a refutation of the paper.** The official Mamba-3 has MIMO (rank-4 lift),
more heads, chunked scans, better init. Our minimal SISO with 8k params is
genuinely under-powered for M≥3. We expect scaling `d_state`, `d_inner`,
or adding MIMO would close this gap — a nice follow-up experiment.

---

## Entry 5 — Ablation: RoPE does all the parity work

**Commit:** `exp: ablate RoPE and trapezoidal on parity`

Added `use_rope` and `use_trap` flags to `Mamba3Block` so each innovation can
be toggled independently. Ran the same parity setup (L=16, 400 steps) four ways.

| Variant | acc_all | acc_last |
|---|---|---|
| full (RoPE + trap) | 99.1% | 96.1% |
| **no trap (RoPE only)** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** |
| no RoPE (trap only) | 60.6% | 50.0% |
| neither | 58.6% | 47.8% |

**Takeaway.** The full credit on parity belongs to the **complex-dynamics
via RoPE** (innovation #2). The trapezoidal gate (#1) contributes zero here
and is marginally noisy. That matches the paper's framing: innovation #1
is a discretization accuracy improvement — the benefit shows up on smooth
dynamics and long-range stability, not on a toggling discrete state.

The two innovations are complementary, not redundant. Parity only exercises
one of them; the other earns its keep elsewhere.

## Entry 6 — Mod 3 is mechanically solved, but brittle

**Commit:** `exp: longer training + curriculum on mod 3/5`

**Attempt 1 (bigger config, same budget) — WORSE.** Bumping to
`d_model=64, d_state=32` tanked everything. Parity dropped from 99.9% → 58%,
mod 3 from 46% → 50%. Classic "more capacity + same training budget = harder
optimization". Lesson: don't scale the model without scaling the schedule.

**Attempt 2 (small config, 8000 steps, train on L=8, eval at L=16) — works
in-distribution, brittle out.**

| M | Train acc (L=8) | Eval acc (L=16) | Chance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 89.0% | 67.5% | 33.3% |
| 5 | 51.2% | 35.6% | 20.0% |

**The big finding — probing the learned angles on mod 3.** Component 3 of
the 8 phase components learned the right thing:

```
Token 1 - Token 0, comp[3]: +113.5° (ideal +120°, 2π/3)  err=0.07 rad
Token 2 - Token 0, comp[3]: -124.0° (ideal -120°)         err=0.07 rad
```

**The model discovered 2π/3 rotation essentially from scratch**, same way it
found -π for parity. Seven other phase components learned miscellaneous angles,
unused.

**Why performance degrades at L=16.** Angle error tolerance scales as 1/M.
A 7° angle error per step is invisible at mod 2 (doesn't cross the ±π/2
decision boundary). At mod 3, 7° over 16 steps = 112° drift — enough to
misclassify into the neighbouring sector. Length extrapolation gets brutal
fast for higher moduli.

**Mod 5.** Stuck at ~35% (vs 20% random). Some learning but far from solving.
Expected at this scale — the angle budget per head is tighter and the
readout decision regions thinner.

**Correct conclusion.** The *algorithm* generalises to any M — rotations are
learned — but the minimal SISO config doesn't have the precision budget to
stabilize them over long sequences at M≥3. The paper's full model uses MIMO,
chunked scans, and careful init to close this gap. The inner mechanism is
the same.

## Entry 7 — Selective copy: gating works too

**Commit:** `exp: selective copy — Mamba-3 gates state writes`

**Task.** Sequence of tokens from `{0..3}`, with a special marker token
at 1–3 random positions. Target: the token immediately after the *last*
marker. All other positions are don't-care. This tests whether the model
can learn to **ignore** most inputs and only write to state on cue — the
opposite of parity (which needs every token).

**Results (L=16 train, 1500 steps, MPS on M4)**

| Model | Acc (L=16) | L=32 | L=64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mamba-3** | **100.0%** | **99.0%** | 72.3% |
| Mamba-2-like | 65.4% | 48.2% | 38.7% |
| Random | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% |

Mamba-3 solves it perfectly by step 200 (loss ≈ 0). Mamba-2-like plateaus
around 65% and never truly cracks it.

**What this tells us.** Mamba-3's advantage isn't limited to cumulative
state tracking (parity). The RoPE-gated dynamics also enable **selective
write** — the model learns to "open the gate" only when the marker appears,
overwriting state with the following token's value. Mamba-2-like can
partially do this (~65%) but can't reliably distinguish "write now" vs
"ignore" across varying marker positions.

**Length generalization.** Same pattern as parity: near-perfect at 2× train
length, degrades at 4×. The state retention mechanism leaks over long gaps
between the last marker and the readout position.

## Entry 8 — Bilingual language model: it speaks (kind of)

**Commit:** `exp: bilingual char-level LM on Tatoeba EN+ES`

**Setup.** First multi-layer Mamba-3 model: 2 stacked blocks with residual
connections + LayerNorm, byte-level (vocab=256), trained on 80k interleaved
`[EN]`/`[ES]` sentences from Tatoeba (~3.7 MB). 253K params. Trained on
Mac mini M4 via MPS, ~24 min for 5000 steps.

**Architecture:** `Embedding → LayerNorm → [Mamba3Block + residual] × 2 → LayerNorm → Linear`
with gradient checkpointing per layer and weight tying (embed ↔ head).

**Training curve** (bits-per-character):

| Step | BPC | Loss |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8.05 | 5.58 |
| 1000 | 2.09 | 1.45 |
| 3000 | 1.82 | 1.26 |
| 5000 | 1.76 | 1.22 |

**What it learned:**
- **Language tag conditioning.** Prompting with `[EN]` produces English-ish
  text, `[ES]` produces Spanish-ish text. The model learned to switch.
- **Spanish morphology.** Verb conjugations (-aron, -ando, -ido), articles
  (el, la, los, las), question marks (¿...?), accented characters (á, é, ó).
- **English structure.** "The church will do you would be it with the same"
  — word order correct, meaning absent. Classic small LM behaviour.
- **Code-switching.** The model naturally transitions between `[EN]` and
  `[ES]` tagged sentences, mirroring the training data format.

**Limitations.** 64-char context window + byte-level + 253K params means
it can't maintain coherence beyond a few words. Many invented words
("suspicionario", "dormidarios", "escribidente"). Gender/number agreement
is spotty. But the *mechanism* — an SSM learning to generate two languages
from a shared state space — works.

**What this proves for Mamba-3.** The RoPE-complex dynamics that solved
parity and selective copy also support genuine language modeling. The
phase rotation mechanism handles the much richer "state" needed for
character-level generation across two languages.

## Entry 9 — The universal step function: what worked and what didn't

**Commit:** `exp: universal step function + multi-task interference`

### Multi-task with separate heads (failed)

Trained one Mamba-3 with task indicator tokens and separate heads for
parity, sorting, counting. d_state=8, 16: parity and counting stuck at
random. Only sorting learned (~67%). The task-indicator-plus-separate-heads
design split the model into three isolated circuits that competed for state.

### Universal step function — no task labels (partial success)

Redesigned: one head, no task labels. Format: `[input...] [SEP] [output...]`.
Five tasks mixed: parity, sort, reverse, minmax, length. The model must
figure out from context what to compute.

Results at step 3000, d_state=16, 31K params:

| Task | Accuracy | Random | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sort | 87% | 6% | ✓ Learned |
| Minmax | 66% | 6% | ✓ Learning |
| Reverse | 64% | 6% | ✓ Learning |
| Parity | 48% | 50% | ✗ Random |
| Length | 2% | 6% | ✗ Random |

Sort, reverse, and minmax are clearly above random. The step function IS
learning to handle multiple tasks. But parity and length are stuck — both
produce a single token after SEP, so the model can't distinguish them.

### Why this is not enough — the Von Neumann insight

**The critical realization:** these successes may be pattern matching over
a small finite space, not genuine algorithms.

- **Sorting with vocab=10** is probably counting sort — the model memorizes
  how many of each value it's seen and outputs them in order. Give it
  vocab=1000 and it would fail. This is a lookup table, not a comparison
  algorithm.
- **Parity with binary** works because there are only 2 input values and
  one trivial rotation. It's the simplest possible case.
- **Reverse with L≤10** might be position memorization, not a general
  reversal algorithm.

**For unbounded solutions** — sorting any numbers, solving Hanoi with any
number of disks — the model needs to learn **micro-operations** (COMPARE,
SWAP, INCREMENT, PUSH/POP) that compose into algorithms, not memorize the
answers for a small vocabulary.

This is the Von Neumann architecture: instructions and data in the same
stream, processed by the same step function. The training data shouldn't
be "here are sorted sequences" but "here is COMPARE executing on two
values, here is SWAP, and here is how they chain into a sort."

### The three layers of mathematical thinking

This exploration led to identifying three layers the model needs:

1. **Numerical computation** (pure step function): `3 + 5 = 8`,
   `COMPARE(7, 3) → 7 > 3`. No symbols, no language. State manipulation.

2. **Symbolic manipulation** (the bridge): Algebra, equation solving,
   simplification. Each step is a rule applied to a pattern:
   `2x + 3 = 7 → 2x = 4 → x = 2`. The rules (DISTRIBUTE, FACTOR,
   SUBSTITUTE, CANCEL) are higher-level micro-operations over expressions,
   not just numbers. A CAS like SymPy can generate these traces.

3. **Mathematical language** (pure orator): "By the commutative property..."
   "Therefore, since x > 0...". This is Brain 1 — explaining, proving.

A mathematician who only has Layer 3 is a poet. A calculator with only
Layer 1 can compute but can't generalize. Layer 2 — symbolic manipulation —
is where language meets computation. Teaching the model this layer is the
key to genuine reasoning.

### What this means for the training data

The training data for the "left brain" (step function) should be
**code-generated execution traces** of micro-operations:

- **Tier 1:** Numerical — ADD, CMP, SWAP, PUSH, POP on concrete values
- **Tier 2:** Symbolic — DISTRIBUTE, FACTOR, SIMPLIFY on algebraic expressions
- **Tier 3:** Composition — chains of micro-ops that implement algorithms

The code generators (sorting algorithms, SymPy, etc.) produce the traces.
The model learns the micro-operations from the traces. And eventually,
Brain 1 (language) learns to WRITE programs of micro-ops that Brain 2
(step function) executes.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full FPGA analogy and experimental plan.

## Entry 10 — Bootstrap Level 0: the adaptive teacher

**Commit:** `train: bootstrap Level 0 with adaptive teacher`

### The bootstrap hypothesis

Human cognition builds in layers: pattern recognition → comparison →
accumulation → composition → recursion → symbolic → language. Each level
bootstraps from the one below. A baby doesn't learn sorting from 10,000
sorted lists — it learns to see patterns, then to compare, then to order.

We designed a 6-level bootstrap curriculum (see `BOOTSTRAP.md`) and built
Level 0: pattern recognition, the substrate for everything above.

### Training evolution

**v1 (baseline):** 10K fixed examples, eval on training data. Reached 77%
but was measuring memorization, not generalization.

**v2 (cycles + fresh data):** Learn→digest cycles with fresh data
regenerated each cycle. Dual eval showing train accuracy, fresh accuracy,
and the gap between them.

| Version | Fresh acc | Gap | Key insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 77% (train data) | unknown | Was memorizing |
| v2 step 500 | 40% | +2.4% | Genuine learning |
| v2 step 4750 | **80%** | -1.0% | Best — cycles work |
| v2 step 9000 | 78% | +0.4% | Holding steady |

The learn→digest cycle was the breakthrough. High LR to absorb new
patterns, low LR to consolidate. Fresh data each cycle prevents
memorization. The gap staying small (<5%) confirms generalization.

### The adaptive teacher

Built a teacher that observes per-type accuracy and adjusts:
- **Task weights:** struggling tasks get more practice (gradually)
- **Difficulty levels:** 3 presets per task, auto-promote when mastered
- **Smooth transitions:** weights move 30% toward target per observation
  to avoid distribution shock

First version was too aggressive (instant weight changes from 1.0 to 2.0),
which caused the model to catastrophically forget — fresh dropped from
80% to 50%. Fixed with smooth transitions.

### Per-type results at best checkpoint (80% overall, fresh data)

| Task | Accuracy | Status |
|---|---|---|
| same_different | 98-100% | ✓ Mastered |
| geometric_next | 94-98% | ✓ Mastered |
| odd_one_out | 83-88% | ✓ Strong |
| mirror_detection | 76-84% | ✓ Good |
| arithmetic_next | 68-80% | ✓ Improving |
| sequence_completion | 72-86% | ✓ Good |
| pattern_period | 44-59% | … Struggling |
| repeat_count | 33-57% | … Struggling (needs Level 2) |

### Lessons learned

1. **Eval must be on fresh data.** Eval on training data hides memorization.
   The train/fresh/gap triple is essential.
2. **Checkpoints must be immutable.** We lost our best 80% checkpoint when
   a bad run overwrote it. Now saved as `level0_step{N}.pt`.
3. **Resume must carry forward best_fresh.** Otherwise the new run thinks
   0% is the baseline and "improves" to 60%.
4. **Teacher adjustments must be gradual.** Instant weight changes cause
   distribution shock. Smooth 30% transitions per observation.
5. **The student is the bottleneck, not the teacher.** The adaptive teacher
   would be capable of teaching a human. One Mamba-3 block at 169K params
   hits its ceiling around 80%. Scaling to more layers and more state
   dimensions is needed.

## Entry 11 — The augmented architecture: registers, spikes, persistent memory

**Commit:** `arch: augmented Mamba-3 with registers + spike gates + persistent memory`

### The insight

The SSM state is `h = decay * h + input` — one fixed-size buffer at one
timescale. Biology has at least four timescales of memory: ion channels
(milliseconds), working memory (seconds), short-term (hours), long-term
(years). Plus explicit mechanisms for deciding WHAT to remember.

Scaling the SSM (more layers, more params) doesn't add new KINDS of state.
It just makes the same buffer bigger. That's like giving a fish a bigger
bowl instead of legs. The architecture needs qualitatively different components.

### The augmented architecture

```
Input → SSM (Mamba-3) → per-step register/memory ops → output
                              ↕               ↕
                       Register Bank    Persistent Memory
                       (working memory) (long-term, slow decay)
                              ↑               ↑
                         Spike Gate       Spike Gate
                       (when to write)  (when to write)
```

**Register Bank (8 slots):** Explicit addressable memory. The model learns
WHEN to write (spike gate), WHERE to write (soft attention over slots),
and WHAT to write. Registers persist across the sequence unless overwritten.
Like CPU registers — small, fast, explicitly controlled.

**Persistent Memory (16 slots):** Same interface but with slow decay
(0.995 per step). Old memories fade unless refreshed. Frequently reinforced
patterns persist naturally. Like biological long-term memory consolidation.

**Spike Gates:** Threshold mechanism initialized to NOT fire (bias=-2.0).
The model must actively learn when something is noteworthy enough to store.
Uses steep sigmoid — output is near-0 (silence) or near-1 (fire). This is
the "aha moment" detector.

### Parameters

| Component | Params | Role |
|---|---|---|
| SSM (Mamba-3) | 28,752 | Sequential processing |
| Register Bank | ~15K | Working memory |
| Persistent Memory | ~15K | Long-term memory |
| Combine + Norm | ~12K | Integration |
| **Total** | **59,562** | **2x plain, not 100x** |

### Key design decisions

1. **Spike gates start silent.** The model begins by relying purely on
   the SSM (which it already knows how to use from Level 0 pretraining).
   Register writes are learned gradually — only when the model discovers
   that storing something helps prediction.

2. **SSM runs first, registers second.** The SSM processes the full
   sequence, then the register layer operates on top. This preserves the
   SSM's proven capabilities while adding new ones.

3. **Three sources combined with residual.** Output = Linear(SSM + reg_read
   + mem_read) + SSM. The residual ensures the SSM's contribution is never
   lost, even if registers are unused.

4. **Not everything is a tensor.** The register addressing and spike
   decisions introduce discrete-ish behavior (sharp sigmoids, argmax-like
   attention). This is intentionally less "smooth" than standard neural
   net operations — it's closer to how actual memory works.

### Hypothesis

If 6 pattern types compete for SSM state (causing the 80% ceiling), the
augmented model should break through by storing each pattern type's
signature in a different register. The SSM detects "this is a sequence
completion task" → spike fires → writes the pattern to register 3. Next
time it needs that pattern, it reads from register 3 instead of trying
to reconstruct it from the decaying SSM state.

### Next: head-to-head comparison

Train plain vs augmented on Level 0 pattern recognition. Same teacher,
same data, same everything. Measure: final fresh accuracy, spike frequency,
register utilization. If the augmented model breaks 80%, the architecture
hypothesis is confirmed.

## Entry 12 — Augmented survey + H100 deployment with Triton

**Commits:** `exp: H100 comparison script` → `perf: Triton kernel for SSM scan`

### Head-to-head results (M4, d_model=64, 3000 steps)

```
Plain:     75.3% fresh  (169,232 params)
Augmented: 67.0% fresh  (199,914 params)
Δ: -8.3%  ← augmented lost
```

The augmented model lost. But *why* matters more than the number.

### Diagnostic survey — what does the augmented model actually do?

We built `exp_augmented_survey.py` to capture per-example internals:
spike rates, register addressing, norms — split by correct vs wrong.

**Key finding: spikes correlate with success.**

```
             reg_spike(output)  mem_spike(output)  final_reg_norm
CORRECT:     0.157              0.097              152.1
WRONG:       0.094              0.050               77.9
```

When the model gets an answer right, it spikes 1.7x more during output
generation and accumulates 2x more register content. The architecture
IS being used — just not enough.

**Register slot distribution:**
- reg[0]: 72% of all writes (dominant)
- reg[4]: 15%, reg[5]: 7%, reg[6]: 6%
- reg[1,2,3,7]: dead (0%)

Only 4 of 8 registers are used. The model hasn't learned to specialize
registers by task type — it's using reg[0] as a generic scratchpad.

**Spike timing: output > input.**
Spikes fire mostly during answer generation, not during question reading.
The model writes to registers while producing output, not while encoding
the problem. This suggests it's using registers as intermediate compute
rather than as structured memory of the input.

### The user's insight: don't constrain, improve the data

We proposed adding sparsity penalties to force selective spiking. The
user rejected this:

> "Why would we make the choice for the model on how much it's going to
> use registers? If you want to steer it, improve the training data."

This is the right call. Penalizing spike rates is us imposing assumptions.
The model should decide how to use its tools — we just need data that
genuinely requires structured memory, not just pattern matching.

### VOCAB_SIZE bug found on CUDA

MPS silently ignores out-of-bounds embedding lookups. CUDA correctly
asserts. Token for n=999 is `64 + 999 + 64 = 1127`, but VOCAB_SIZE
was 1088. Fixed to 1152. This bug existed since the bootstrap was built
but never caused visible failures on Apple Silicon.

**Lesson:** MPS is forgiving. CUDA is correct. Always test on CUDA.

### H100 deployment — from 56% to 100% GPU utilization

**Problem:** Our pure-Python sequential scan launched one tiny CUDA kernel
per timestep per batch. The H100 finished each kernel in microseconds
then waited for Python to schedule the next one.

**Optimizations applied (incremental):**

1. **Precompute outer products** — moved all batch-parallel ops (einsum,
   trapezoidal blending, gating) out of the per-timestep loop. The Python
   loop body shrank to just state multiply-add + output contraction.
   *Result: faster, still ~56% GPU.*

2. **BF16 mixed precision** — H100 native bfloat16. Free 2x throughput
   on matmuls. *Result: marginal improvement, not the bottleneck.*

3. **Batch 64 → 4096** — sequences are tiny (avg 20 tokens, max 75).
   With d_model=256, total VRAM is still ~315MB on an 80GB GPU.
   *Result: more parallel work per kernel, up to ~60% GPU.*

4. **Triton kernel** — eliminated the Python for-loop entirely.
   Each thread block handles one (batch, head) pair and loops L steps
   in GPU registers. With batch=4096 and 16 heads = 65K thread blocks.
   *Result: 100% GPU, 43GB VRAM, 0.69ms per scan call.*

```
         Before Triton    After Triton
GPU:     56%              100%
ms/step: 16-19ms          TBD (running now)
ex/s:    ~30K             TBD
```

**Architecture of the Triton kernel (`ssm_triton_kernel.py`):**

```
one program per (batch_idx, head_idx):
    h[hD, dS] = zeros  // state in registers
    for t in 0..L:
        h = decay[t] * h + inp[t]           // state update
        y[t] = sum(h * C[t]) + D * x[t]     // output
        y[t] *= silu(z[t])                   // gate
        store y[t]
```

No Python. No kernel launch overhead per timestep. The recurrence is
inherently sequential over L, but L≈20 — the parallelism comes from
the 65K independent (batch, head) pairs running simultaneously.

**Fallback:** `torch.jit.script` version for MPS/CPU. Same loop, JIT-
compiled so no Python interpreter overhead. Dispatched automatically
based on device.

### Current: H100 running d_model=256, batch=4096, 10K steps

Both plain and augmented models with adaptive teacher. This is the
first run where:
- The GPU is actually saturated
- The model is large enough to potentially generalize (1M params)
- Both models get the same adaptive curriculum

If the augmented model still loses at this scale, the architecture
needs rethinking. If it wins, we have our brain of a fly.

## Entry 13 — Curriculum v2: progressive unlock + grokking

**Commits:** `curriculum: 15-task progressive unlock` → `grok: Grokfast EMA`

### The memorization trap (what failed)

Three successive H100 runs all showed the same pattern:

```
d_model=64,  batch=64,   old teacher:  92% train, 33% fresh, 59% gap
d_model=128, batch=2048, old teacher:  100% train, 7% fresh, 93% gap
d_model=256, batch=4096, old teacher:  100% train, 6% fresh, 94% gap
```

More params and more compute made it *memorize faster*, not generalize
better. The model learned a lookup table, not an algorithm. The gap
throttle (reducing LR when train>>fresh) just slowed down training
without fixing the root cause.

### The fix: curriculum design, not model scaling

Two insights from the user:

1. **"Improve the training data"** — don't penalize the model for
   memorizing, give it data that *requires* algorithms.

2. **"Start with parity, master it, then add the next problem"** —
   sequential task unlock, not all 8 tasks at once.

### 15-task curriculum with progressive unlock

Tasks unlock one at a time, in cognitive order. Each task teaches a
skill the next one needs:

```
Stage 0: Binary foundations
  1. parity                — count 1s mod 2 (SSM state tracking)
  2. binary_pattern_next   — detect cycles in 0/1 streams

Stage 1: Comparison
  3. same_different        — compare two values
  4. odd_one_out           — find the outlier in N values

Stage 2: Pattern detection
  5. sequence_completion   — predict next in repeating pattern
  6. pattern_period        — identify cycle length
  7. run_length_next       — detect run-length encoding patterns

Stage 3: Sequence memory
  8. mirror_detection      — palindrome detection (needs memory)
  9. repeat_count          — accumulate counts (needs registers)

Stage 4: Arithmetic reasoning
  10. arithmetic_next      — detect and apply arithmetic step
  11. geometric_next       — detect and apply ratio
  12. alternating_next     — two interleaved sequences

Stage 5: Logic
  13. logic_gate           — AND/OR/XOR/NOT evaluation
  14. logic_chain          — chained gate evaluation
  15. modus_ponens         — propositional logic (IF p THEN q)
```

Unlock rule: all current tasks mastered (90%+ fresh) at difficulty ≥ 0.3
before the next task is introduced.

Difficulty scales continuously [0.0, 1.0] per task — starts trivially
easy (length 3, numbers 0-3), only advances on fresh accuracy. By the
time difficulty is high, memorization is impossible.

### Final boss: 18 unseen task types

When all 15 tasks are mastered, boss mode activates with never-seen
tasks: set operations (union, intersection, subset), sorting, min/max,
range, sum, modular arithmetic, reverse, rotate, deduplicate, XOR,
count ones, unique count, majority element, second largest.

If the model truly learned algorithms and not formats, it should handle
these with minimal examples.

### Samples-to-mastery metric

Each task records when it was unlocked and when it first hit 90% fresh.
The key question: does task N+1 take fewer examples than task N?

If yes → the model is **learning to learn**.

### Grokking: the phase transition we need

Research (Power et al. 2022, Grokfast 2024) shows that with the right
setup, models can suddenly generalize *long after* memorizing — the
"grokking" phenomenon. The memorization circuit is expensive (high
weight norm); weight decay slowly erodes it until a cheaper algorithm
circuit takes over.

**Changes for grokking:**

| Parameter | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Weight decay | 0.01 | 0.1 |
| LR schedule | Gap throttle | Constant |
| Batch size | 4096 | 128 |
| Grokfast | OFF | alpha=0.98 |

**Grokfast** (Lee et al. 2024): EMA low-pass filter on gradients.
Amplifies slow-varying (generalizing) gradient components, suppresses
fast (memorizing) ones. Reported 50x speedup to grokking.

```python
# After loss.backward(), before opt.step():
ema[p] = alpha * ema[p] + (1-alpha) * p.grad
p.grad += ema[p]  # boost the slow signal
```

### First results: it works

```
Step 2000:  parity MASTERED (100% fresh, difficulty 0.00→0.05)
            30,000 examples to master

Step 12000: parity difficulty reached 0.30
            → binary_pattern_next UNLOCKED

Step 12000: same_different already at 60% fresh — NEVER TRAINED ON IT
            (transfer from parity!)
```

The curriculum is advancing. Parity was mastered, difficulty scaled up
to 0.30 while maintaining mastery, and the second task unlocked.

Most interesting: `same_different` (comparing two values) is already
at 60% accuracy despite being locked. The model learned something
about comparison *from parity training alone*. This is genuine transfer
— the algorithm generalized beyond the task it was trained on.

The 11% "fresh accuracy" we saw was misleading — it was testing all
15 task types when only 1 was trained. Per-type accuracy on the
trained task was 100%.

### Architecture note

This run uses plain Mamba-3 (no augmented). The curriculum should
first prove that the *training signal* can produce generalization.
Once we have a generalizing plain model, we add registers/spikes
and test whether they accelerate learning or enable harder tasks
the plain model can't do.

## Entry 14 — The roadmap: from puzzle solver to formal reasoning

### Where we are

The curriculum trains the model on 15 specific task types, one at a time.
Parity is mastered. Binary patterns mastered in fewer examples (transfer!).
The model is climbing the difficulty ladder.

But 15 task types is still a fixed set. The real test is what comes next.

### The three leaps

**Leap 1: Generalized puzzle solver (meta-learning)**

The model should solve tasks it has *never been trained on*, given only
a few examples. This is in-context learning / few-shot reasoning:

```
Example: 3 5 → 8, 2 7 → 9, 4 1 → ?
Answer: 5  (the model inferred "addition" from two examples)
```

How to get there:
- The curriculum builds atomic skills (compare, count, detect patterns)
- The boss tasks test whether these skills compose into new abilities
- True few-shot eval: present 2-3 examples of a novel task type,
  ask the model to infer the rule and apply it
- If it can do this, it has learned *how to learn patterns*, not just
  specific patterns

The key metric: **zero-shot accuracy on novel task types.** After
training on 15 types + 18 boss types, generate a *34th* type the model
has never seen. Can it figure it out?

**Leap 2: Language as interface**

The model goes from *doing* to *explaining*. Four levels:

```
Level A: Solve silently (current — outputs just the answer)
Level B: Solve + state the rule ("the pattern repeats every 3")
Level C: Express rules formally ("∀n: a(n+3) = a(n)")
Level D: Chain rules into proofs ("periodic ∧ arithmetic → closed form")
```

This requires switching to the bilingual byte-level LM (`mamba3_lm.py`)
and training on reasoning traces where the model shows its work.

The seeds we built with Cerebras (thinking + answer + python) were
exactly this format. The curriculum provides the *grounding* — when
the model writes "I'll compare adjacent pairs," it has actually learned
what comparison means from Level 0-1 training.

**Leap 3: Formal mathematics**

Once the model can express reasoning in language, the next step is
formal notation:

```
Natural:  "the sequence increases by 3 each time"
Formal:   a(n) = a(0) + 3n
Proof:    ∀n ∈ ℕ: a(n+1) - a(n) = 3  (by induction on training examples)
```

The path: logic gates → propositional logic (modus ponens, already in
curriculum) → predicate logic → simple proofs → induction → algebraic
manipulation (SymPy traces from BOOTSTRAP.md Level 5).

### Checkpoint strategy

The curriculum checkpoint is small (~2MB for 405K params). Can be
committed directly to git. To continue training:

```python
cfg = Mamba3Config(d_model=128, d_state=16, expand=2, headdim=16)
model = PlainModel(cfg).to(device)
ckpt = torch.load("curriculum_best.pt", map_location=device)
model.load_state_dict(ckpt["model"])
# Continue training on new data (language, formal math)
```

The SSM state representations carry forward. Skills learned in Level 0
(parity, patterns) become the substrate for Level 1+ reasoning.

### The ultimate validation

Give the model a problem it has *never* seen, in *natural language*:

```
User: "Is 371 an Armstrong number?"

Model thinking:
  An Armstrong number has digits whose cubes sum to itself.
  371 → digits: 3, 7, 1
  3³ = 27, 7³ = 343, 1³ = 1
  27 + 343 + 1 = 371 = original
  → YES

Model output: Yes, 371 is an Armstrong number.
  3³ + 7³ + 1³ = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371 ✓
```

The thinking block uses real operations the model learned:
decomposition (Level 0), exponentiation (Level 4), summation (Level 2),
comparison (Level 1). Language (Level 6) is the interface.

If this works, we have a system that reasons — not because it memorized
Armstrong numbers, but because it bootstrapped from parity to formal
mathematics through six levels of increasingly powerful computation.

The brain of a fly, becoming the brain of a human.

## Open threads

- **Curriculum run in progress.** H100, 100K steps, grokking-aware.
  Parity mastered, binary_pattern_next mastered, climbing difficulty.
- **Samples-to-mastery tracking.** Task 1: 30K examples. Task 2: 13K
  examples. Watching for acceleration.
- **Transfer learning.** same_different at 60% without training = free
  transfer. Track which tasks benefit from prior learning.
- **Augmented model.** Once plain model advances through curriculum,
  re-run with registers/spikes. Hypothesis: registers help at Stage 3+
  (sequence memory tasks that need structured storage).
- **Few-shot eval.** After curriculum, test on completely novel task
  types with only 2-3 in-context examples.
- **Language transition.** Switch to byte-level LM, train on reasoning
  traces. The curriculum checkpoint becomes the foundation.
- **Formal math.** SymPy-generated algebraic traces (BOOTSTRAP.md L5).
- **The compilation problem.** How Brain 1 (language) learns to program
  Brain 2 (step function). The hardest open question.
